## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Tor daemon running and accessible
- Linux/macOS/Windows (tested on Linux)

### Tor Setup
1. Install Tor:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install tor
   
   # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
   sudo dnf install tor
   
   # macOS
   brew install tor
   ```

2. Configure Tor (`/etc/tor/torrc`):
   ```bash
   # Add these lines to /etc/tor/torrc
   ControlPort 9051
   CookieAuthentication 1
   SocksPort 9050
   ```

3. Start Tor service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start tor
   sudo systemctl enable tor
   ```

4. Verify Tor is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status tor
   ```

### Python Dependencies
The tool requires the following Python packages (automatically installed):
- `requests[socks]` - HTTP requests with SOCKS proxy support
- `stem` - Python controller library for Tor
- `PyYAML` - YAML configuration file parsing

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone or download the project:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dirty-waters
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests[socks] stem pyyaml
   ```

3. Ensure Tor is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start tor
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to configure your attack parameters:

```yaml

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tor Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check if Tor is running
sudo systemctl status tor

# Check Tor configuration
sudo cat /etc/tor/torrc | grep -E "(ControlPort|SocksPort)"

# Restart Tor service
sudo systemctl restart tor
```

**Permission Denied on Control Port**
```bash
# Add user to debian-tor group (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor $USER

# Or run with sudo (not recommended)
sudo python main.py
```

**Target Unreachable**
```bash
# Test direct connection
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 http://target-url.com

# Check target URL format
# Ensure URL includes full path to wp-login.php
```

**Password List Issues**
```bash
# Check file exists and is readable
ls -la passwords.txt

# Verify file encoding (should be UTF-8)
file passwords.txt
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Responsible Use
- Only test systems you own or have permission to test
- Respect rate limits to avoid service disruption
- Use strong passwords for your own systems
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities

### Anonymity
- All traffic routed through Tor network
- Automatic IP rotation via circuit changes
- No local storage of sensitive data
- Clean exit prevents data leakage

### Limitations
- Requires working Tor connection
- Subject to Tor network latency
- May be detected by WAFs or rate limiting
- Success depends on password list quality

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- Code follows Python style guidelines
- All features include comprehensive tests
